# Programming Assignment 02

Download the following text file:

[**IntegerArray.txt**](https://github.com/LucasBoTang/Coursera_Algorithms/blob/master/01Divide_and_Conquer_Sorting_and_Searching_and_Randomized_Algorithms/Assignment02/IntegerArray.txt)

This file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.

Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the ith row of the file indicates the ith entry of an array.

Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm covered in the video lectures.

The numeric answer for the given input file should be typed in the space below.
